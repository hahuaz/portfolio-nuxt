          I ask the question myself a lot by the way. I don’t like to define
          myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to
          do. Skills can be taught. I prefer to keep learning, continue
          challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am passionate about what I do. I like to make things from scratch
          because it gives me the ability to manage everything on that thing.
          Thus, I can bring my ideas and wishes to life without any attachments.

          <br />

          At 24, I mostly spend my time with coding. I am business-oriented and
          these days working a lot. The only limitations in my work are my
          skills and ideas, which encourages me to produce more.
